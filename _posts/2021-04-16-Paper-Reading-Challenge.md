# Paper reading challenge 

I’ve been thinking and there is a good bit of biology and CS that I don’t understand yet, that I want to understand.  So I’ve decided to read and gain an understanding of at least one scientific paper per day for the next few months. 

I'll post a summary of the paper and a link for the paper on this blog. The first paper I will be discussing will be the [How to Read a Paper](https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee384m/Handouts/HowtoReadPaper.pdf)  paper, by S. Keshav.  

## How to read a paper summary
This paper was quite short, but I have posted a summary below:
 
- Learning how to read papers is critical, but not normally taught
- Three Pass Approach to reading papers
	- **First** pass is to get a birds eye view of the paper and decide if you want to read it in the first place
	- **Second** pass is to read the paper with greater care, looking at figures, and understanding key points, and being able to summarize the main objective of the paper to someone else 
	- **Third** pass is to attempt to virtually re-impliment the paper in your own mind, challenging the statements of the authors 
- Doing a literature survey is a way to get up to speed on many different papers in a discipline, and sometimes these review papers already exist which makes life easier, 

Overall I think I agree with this approach to reading papers and will use it in the future.  I do think the third pass in the three page method was something that I didn't know and really useful.
