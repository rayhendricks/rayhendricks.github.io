There is a good bit of biology and CS that I donâ€™t understand yet, that I want to understand.  

I'll post a summary of the paper and a link for the paper on this blog. The first paper I will be discussing will be the [How to Read a Paper](https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee384m/Handouts/HowtoReadPaper.pdf)  paper, by S. Keshav.  

## How to read a paper summary
This paper was quite short, but I have posted a summary below:
 
- Learning how to read papers is critical, but not normally taught in university
- Three Pass Approach to reading papers
	- **First** pass is to get a bird's eye view of the paper and decide if you want to read it in the first place by reading the abstract, introduction, and subheadings
	- **Second** pass is to read the paper with greater care, looking at figures, and understanding key points, and being able to summarize and explain the main objective of the paper to someone else who has not read the paper
	- **Third** pass is to attempt to virtually re-implement the paper in your own mind, challenging the statements of the authors 
- Doing a literature survey is a way to get up to speed on many different papers in a discipline, and sometimes these review papers already exist which makes life easier, 

Overall I think I agree with this approach to reading papers and will use it in the future.  I do think the third pass in the three page method, where you try and virtually re-implement the paper was something that I didn't know and really useful.  

The other question that the reading and understanding this paper has led me to is how would it be possible to incorporate techniques for a better understanding and also for better retention of the knowledge cointained in papers. What if active recall was also incorporated into this strategy?
